(62, 19, 'PGA Tour', 'www.pgatour.com', 'The PGA Tour (officially rendered in all capital letters, as PGA TOUR) is the organizer of the main professional golf tours played primarily by men in the United States and North America. It organizes most of the events on the flagship annual series of tournaments also known as the PGA Tour, as well as the Champions Tour (for golfers age 50 and older) and the Web.com Tour (for professional players who have not yet qualified to play in the PGA Tour), as well as PGA Tour Canada, PGA Tour LatinoamÃ©rica, and PGA Tour China. It is headquartered in Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida, a suburb of Jacksonville.\r\n\r\nOriginally established by the Professional Golfers Association of America, it was spun off in December 1968 into a separate organization for tour players, as opposed to club professionals, the focal members of todays PGA of America. Originally the "Tournament Players Division," it adopted the name "PGA Tour" in 1975 and runs most of the week-to-week professional golf events on the tournament known as the PGA Tour, including The Players Championship, hosted at TPC Sawgrass, the FedEx Cup, and the biennial Presidents Cup. The remaining events on the PGA Tour are run by different organizations, as are the U.S.-based LPGA Tour for women and the other mens and womens professional tours around the world.\r\n\r\nThe tour began in 1929 and at various times the tournament players had attempted to operate independently from the club professionals. With an increase of revenue in the late 1960s due to expanded television coverage, a dispute arose between the touring professionals and the PGA of America on how to distribute the windfall. The tour players wanted larger purses, where the PGA desired the money to go to the general fund to help grow the game at the local level. Following the final major in July 1968 at the PGA Championship, several leading tour pros voiced their dissatisfaction with the venue and the abundance of club pros in the field. The increased friction resulted in a new entity in August, what would eventually become the PGA Tour. Tournament players formed their own organization, American Professional Golfers, Inc. (APG), independent of the PGA of America.\r\n\r\nAfter several months, a compromise was reached in December: the tour players agreed to abolish the APG and form the PGA "Tournament Players Division," a fully autonomous division under the supervision of a new 10-member Tournament Policy Board. The board consisted of four tour players, three PGA of America executives, and three outside members, initially business executives.\r\n\r\nJoseph Dey, the recently retired USGA executive director, was selected by the board as the tours first commissioner in January 1969 and agreed to a five-year contract. He was succeeded by tour player Deane Beman in early 1974, who served for twenty years. The name officially changed to the "PGA Tour" in 1975. Beman was succeeded by current commissioner Tim Finchem in June 1994.\r\n\r\nIn late August 1981, the PGA Tour had a marketing dispute with the PGA of America and officially changed its name to the "TPA Tour," for the "Tournament Players Association." The disputed issues were resolved within seven months and the tours name was changed back to the "PGA Tour" in March 1982.\r\n\r\nWithout the tour players, the PGA of America became primarily an association of club professionals, but retained control of two significant events; the PGA Championship and the Ryder Cup. The former was an established major championship, but the latter was an obscure match play team event which was not particularly popular with golf fans, due to predictable dominance by the United States. With the addition of players from continental Europe in 1979 and expanded television coverage, it became very competitive and evolved into the premier international team event, lately dominated by Europe. Both events are very important revenue streams for the PGA of America.', 'quvqqr1423564787.png', 'uppyws1423567146.png'),

For instance, the 1948 ABL finalist Baltimore Bullets moved to the BAA and won that leagues 1948 title, and the 1948 NBL champion Minneapolis Lakers won the 1949 BAA title.

The process of contraction saw the leagues smaller-city franchises move to larger cities. The Hawks shifted from "Tri-Cities" (the area now known as the Quad Cities) to Milwaukee (in 1951) and then to St. Louis, Missouri (in 1955); the Royals from Rochester, New York to Cincinnati (in 1957); and the Pistons from Fort Wayne, Indiana to Detroit (in 1957).\r\n\r\nJapanese-American Wataru Misaka broke the NBA color barrier in the 1947â€“48 season when he played for the New York Knicks.

It is headquartered in Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida, a suburb of Jacksonville.\r\n\r\nOriginally established by the Professional Golfers Association of America, it was spun off in December 1968 into a separate organization for tour players, as opposed to club professionals, the focal members of todays PGA of America. Originally the "Tournament Players Division," it adopted the name "PGA Tour" in 1975 and runs most of the week-to-week professional golf events on the tournament known as the PGA Tour, including The Players Championship, hosted at TPC Sawgrass, the FedEx Cup, and the biennial Presidents Cup. The remaining events on the PGA Tour are run by different organizations, as are the U.S.-based LPGA Tour for women and the other mens and womens professional tours around the world.\r\n\r\nThe tour began in 1929 and at various times the tournament players had attempted to operate independently from the club professionals. With an increase of revenue in the late 1960s due to expanded television coverage, a dispute arose between the touring professionals and the PGA of America on how to distribute the windfall. The tour players wanted larger purses, where the PGA desired the money to go to the general fund to help grow the game at the local level. Following the final major in July 1968 at the PGA Championship, several leading tour pros voiced their dissatisfaction with the venue and the abundance of club pros in the field. The increased friction resulted in a new entity in August, what would eventually become the PGA Tour. Tournament players formed their own organization, American Professional Golfers, Inc. (APG), independent of the PGA of America.\r\n\r\nAfter several months, a compromise was reached in December: the tour players agreed to abolish the APG and form the PGA "Tournament Players Division," a fully autonomous division under the supervision of a new 10-member Tournament Policy Board. The board consisted of four tour players, three PGA of America executives, and three outside members, initially business executives.\r\n\r\nJoseph Dey, the recently retired USGA executive director, was selected by the board as the tours first commissioner in January 1969 and agreed to a five-year contract.

Beman was succeeded by current commissioner Tim Finchem in June 1994.\r\n\r\nIn late August 1981, the PGA Tour had a marketing dispute with the PGA of America and officially changed its name to the "TPA Tour," for the "Tournament Players Association." The disputed issues were resolved within seven months and the tours name was changed back to the "PGA Tour" in March 1982.\r\n\r\nWithout the tour players, the PGA of America became primarily an association of club professionals, but retained control of two significant events; the PGA Championship and the Ryder Cup. The former was an established major championship, but the latter was an obscure match play team event which was not particularly popular with golf fans, due to predictable dominance by the United States.

It has 30 franchised member clubs (29 in the United States and 1 in Canada), and is an active member of USA Basketball (USAB), which is recognized by FIBA (also known as the International Basketball Federation) as the national governing body for basketball in the United States. The NBA is one of the four major North American professional sports leagues. NBA players are the worlds best paid sportsmen, by average annual salary per player.\r\n\r\nThe league was founded in New York City on June 6, 1946, as the Basketball Association of America (BAA). The league adopted the name National Basketball Association on August 3, 1949, after merging with its rival National Basketball League (NBL). The leagues several international as well as individual team offices are directed out of its head offices located in the Olympic Tower at 645 Fifth Avenue in New York City. NBA Entertainment and NBA TV studios are directed out of offices located in Secaucus, New Jersey.\r\n\r\nThe Basketball Association of America was founded in 1946 by owners of the major ice hockey arenas in the Northeastern and Midwestern United States and Canada. On November 1, 1946, in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, the Toronto Huskies hosted the New York Knickerbockers at Maple Leaf Gardens, in a game the NBA now regards as the first played in its history. The first basket was made by Ossie Schectman of the Knickerbockers. Although there had been earlier attempts at professional basketball leagues, including the American Basketball League and the NBL, the BAA was the first league to attempt to play primarily in large arenas in major cities. During its early years, the quality of play in the BAA was not significantly better than in competing leagues or among leading independent clubs such as the Harlem Globetrotters. For instance, the 1948 ABL finalist Baltimore Bullets moved to the BAA and won that leagues 1948 title, and the 1948 NBL champion Minneapolis Lakers won the 1949 BAA title. Prior to the 1948-49 season, however, NBL teams from Fort Wayne, Indianapolis, Minneapolis, and Rochester jumped to the BAA, which established the BAA as the league of choice for collegians looking to turn professional.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe headquarters of the National Basketball Association in the Olympic Tower at 645 Fifth Avenue, Midtown Manhattan, New York City, USA.\r\nFollowing the 1948-49 season, the BAA took in the remainder of the NBL: Syracuse, Anderson, Tri-Cities, Sheboygan, Denver, and Waterloo. In deference to the merger and to avoid possible legal complications, the league name was changed from the BAA to the National Basketball Association in spite of having the same BAA governing body including Podoloff. The new league had seventeen franchises located in a mix of large and small cities, as well as large arenas and smaller gymnasiums and armories. In 1950, the NBA consolidated to eleven franchises, a process that continued until 1953â€“54, when the league reached its smallest size of eight franchises, all of which are still in the league (the New York Knicks, Boston Celtics, Golden State Warriors, Los Angeles Lakers, Royals/Kings, Detroit Pistons, Atlanta Hawks, and Nationals/76ers). The process of contraction saw the leagues smaller-city franchises move to larger cities. The Hawks shifted from "Tri-Cities" (the area now known as the Quad Cities) to Milwaukee (in 1951) and then to St. Louis, Missouri (in 1955); the Royals from Rochester, New York to Cincinnati (in 1957); and the Pistons from Fort Wayne, Indiana to Detroit (in 1957).\r\n\r\nJapanese-American Wataru Misaka broke the NBA color barrier in the 1947â€“48 season when he played for the New York Knicks. He remained the only non-white player in league history prior to the first African-American, Harold Hunter, signing with the Washington Capitols in 1950. Hunter was cut from the team during training camp, but several African-American players did play in the league later that year, including Chuck Cooper with the Celtics, Nathaniel "Sweetwater" Clifton with the Knicks, and Earl Lloyd with the Washington Capitols. During this period, the Minneapolis Lakers, led by center George Mikan, won five NBA Championships and established themselves as the leagues first dynasty. To encourage shooting and discourage stalling, the league introduced the 24-second shot clock in 1954. If a team does not attempt to score a field goal (or the ball fails to make contact with the rim) within 24 seconds of obtaining the ball, play is stopped and the ball given to its opponent.', 'http://www.thesportsdb.com/images/media/league/fanart/tvuuyw1421695179.jpg', 'http://www.thesportsdb.com/images/media/league/badge/rwpxsw1421413099.png', 'http://www.thesportsdb.com/images/media/league/logo/ypuryw1421971236.png', 'http://www.thesportsdb.com/images/media/league/trophy/vwwvxx1421694713.png'),

The first few decades of professional baseball were characterized by rivalries between leagues and by players who often jumped from one team or league to another.

Baseball survived a game-throwing incident known as the Black Sox Scandal in the 1919 World Series. Baseball rose in popularity in the 1920s, and survived potential downturns during the Great Depression and World War II. Shortly after the war, baseballs color barrier was broken by Jackie Robinson.\r\n\r\nThe 1950s and 1960s were a time of expansion for the AL and NL, then new stadiums and artificial turf surfaces began to change the game in the 1970s and 1980s.

Home team, Adelaide United regularly fill this capacity, and averaged crowds of over 12,000 to its matches during the 2006/2007 Season and 2007/2008 Season.

However, the Soccer Association had received negative press regarding its failure to grow grass on the site. Rowley Park also had a tendency to flood during winter as the bottom of "The Brick Pit" was below the level of the water table which made playing soccer virtually impossible. The land was eventually leased to a group of speedway drivers and would become the famous Rowley Park Speedway which ran from December 1949 until it closed in April 1979. The land was eventually sold and is now the Kym Bonython housing estate, named for the speedways long time promoter Kym Bonython.\r\n\r\nWhen it became obvious to the Soccer Association that Rowley Park would be unsuitable as a soccer venue they obtained a lease on Hindmarsh Oval from the Hindmarsh Council. The old Hindmarsh Oval was developed over the years into a rectangular stadium capable of holding 15,000 with a single tier grandstand built in 1960 that held approximately 2,000 while 6 light towers for night games (plus another 8 smaller light towers on the grandstand roof) were installed during the mid-1970s.

It is within walking distance of the Gosford CBD and Gosford railway station. The Central Coast Leagues Club and League Club Field are adjacent to the stadium, across Dane Drive.\r\n\r\nIn 1911, Erina Shire Council proposed to create a park on the shore of Brisbane Water. The park required much land to be reclaimed from marshland. It also required privately owned land to be purchased by council and a section of road to be demolished. Waterside Park was opened in 1915 and a cricket pitch was added during that year. Further reclamation of the foreshore extended the park during the Depression that gave work to the unemployed. By 1939 surplus railway land had been added and a Bowling Club and green as well as tennis courts had been constructed. In 1939 the Park was renamed Grahame Park, after the then mayor of Gosford, William Calman Grahame.\r\n\r\nA full stadium was then touted and later built in the late 1990s, planned to be ready in 1999 for NRL club the North Sydney Bears, before construction problems including large spells of inclement weather delayed completion.

The stadium gained its second full-time tenant in 2005 with the formation of the Central Coast Mariners, a team in the newly formed national A-League soccer competition. It became the first full-time national sporting competition to have a team play at the stadium. Further use of the stadium in 2006 follows from it being the home ground to the Central Coast Waves rugby union team, which joined the Shute Shield in 2006.

Morumbi is the largest privately owned stadium in Brazil. The stadium was designed by the architect JoÃ£o Batista Vilanova Artigas.\r\nIn the early years of its existence, SÃ£o Paulo Futebol Clube used for their headquarters and home field the ChÃ¡cara da Floresta, located beside the Ponte das Bandeiras next to the TietÃª river in the center of SÃ£o Paulo. For this reason, the first incarnation of the club, that existed from 1930 to 1935, is referred to as "SÃ£o Paulo da Floresta".\r\n\r\nWhen the club was refounded in December 1935, since the ChÃ¡cara da Floresta now belonged to Clube de Regatas TietÃª, which had absorbed the original SÃ£o Paulo Futebol Clube, the refounded SÃ£o Paulo didnt have its own field. From 1936, it began to rent the AntÃ´nio Alonso stadium, which then belonged to Clube AtlÃ©tico Paulista. In 1938, after merging with Estudantes Paulista (originated in 1937 by the merger of Estudantes de SÃ£o Paulo and Paulista) SÃ£o Paulo acquired the AntÃ´nio Alonso. When the EstÃ¡dio do Pacaembu was inaugurated in 1940, SÃ£o Paulo began to use it as a home field. the AntÃ´nio Alonso stadium was sold to Juventus in 1942.\r\n\r\nIn 1944, SÃ£o Paulo bought a piece of ground called CanindÃ©, which was only used as a headquarters and training location. The area was too small for the construction of a large stadium, so studies were done to find another home within the city of SÃ£o Paulo.\r\n\r\nIn 1952, SÃ£o Paulos chairman CÃ­cero Pompeu de Toledo requested from the citys mayor, Armando de Arruda Pereira, a groundplot in the Ibirapuera neighborhood.

It was designed with effective crowd management in mind (given Millwalls crowd problems at The Old Den), with the escape routes being short and direct. After chairman Reg Burr decided that it would not be viable to redevelop The Den as an all-seater stadium, he announced during 1990 that Millwall would be relocating to a new stadium in the Senegal Fields area. Originally, it was planned to have a seating capacity of between 25,000 to 30,000. Millwall however, could not meet the additional cost.\r\n\r\nView from the West lower stand against Charlton Athletic during a 4-0 win in the 09-10 season.\r\nMillwall played their final game on 8 May 1993 at The Old Den after 83 years, and moved to the new 20,000 all-seater stadium a quarter of a mile away from Cold Blow Lane. The Â£16 million Den was opened by John Smith MP (leader of the Labour Party and Opposition at the time) on 4 August 1993 prior to a prestigious friendly against Sporting Lisbon which Sporting won by 2-1. The Den was the first new football stadium constructed for a professional team in London since 1937.\r\n\r\nMillwall have experienced mixed fortunes since relocating to The Den. Their first season at the stadium (1993-94) saw them finish third in Division Oneâ€”their highest finish since relegation from the top flight four years earlier. However, their dreams of Premier League football were ended by a defeat in the playoffs and they were relegated to Division Two in 1996, not winning promotion from that level until 2001. They came close to reaching the Premier League again in 2002, finishing fourth but once again losing in the playoffs. The Lions reached the FA Cup final for the first time in 2004, and despite a 3-0 defeat by Manchester United they qualified for a European competition for the very first time (although their UEFA Cup campaign was short lived). Relegation from the newly named Football League Championship (second highest division in England) followed in 2006. They were promoted back to the N-Power Championship, via a 1-0 win against Swindon Town at Wembley in 2010.', 'Bermondsey, London, England', 'www.millwallfc.co.uk', 'www.facebook.com/MillwallFCOfficial', 'www.twitter.com/MillwallFC', '', '', 'http://www.thesportsdb.com/images/media/team/badge/uuptsy1448759556.png', 'http://www.thesportsdb.com/images/media/team/jersey/tqruss1423792070.png', ''),

It was not fully enclosed until the summer of 1955, when Briggs Sports moved out to Rush Green Road, and Dagenham F.C. moved from the Arena. During that summer they levelled and re-seeded the pitch, removed the stones from the playing surface and extended the banking and the terracing. The only cover was a tiny wooden stand, which was steep and narrow and had a few rows of seating on the far side of the ground. The main stand was built in the autumn of 1955 and was opened on 7 January 1956 by J.W. Bowers, chairman of the Essex County Football Association. During the summer of 1956 the turnstile block at the Victoria Road side of the ground and the mens toilets situated at the Victoria Road were added. In the summer of 1958 the cover over the far side was erected at a cost of Â£1,400. The first floodlitBrian Cox match at Victoria Road was Dagenham v Woodford in the FA Youth Cup on 26 September 1957 and the first senior match was a friendly against Rainham Town F.C. on 19 March 1958.

They paid for a new stand to be erected in the corner of the ground to increase the seating capacity and replaced the grass banking with concrete terracing. These improvements brought the ground up to the standard required by the Football Conference. Redbridge Forest and Dagenham merged in July 1992 and the ground improvements have continued right up to the present day. In 1995 they replaced the crumbling pitch perimeter wall with a new brick-built one and two years later rebuilt the toilet block at the Victoria Road end of the ground. The club brought in Bill ONeil from Atcost to design and build a new purpose-built stand. The new 800-seater, which brings the seating capacity to over a thousand, was used for the first time for the Essex Senior Cup final against Canvey Island on 4 August 2001, twelve weeks after the old stand was last used. During summer 2001 new turnstile blocks were constructed and the eight floodlights were replaced with four corner ones.\r\n\r\nIn October 2001, Bass brewers agreed a Â£150,000 sponsorship of the new stand, now named the Carling Stand. This provided the funds for the improvements to continue and a number of crush barriers were installed in 2002, which helped ease the flow of spectators around the ground along with a new walkway behind the covered terrace. Whilst the Dagenham & Redbridge record attendance is 5,949, set against Ipswich Town in January 2002, these improvements have enabled the ground to meet Football League status and the capacity is now 6,078.

The club also purchased more land behind the northern end of the ground, with the intention of enlarging the stand and building a leisure centre. However, the club ran out of money during its construction and abandoned the scheme in 1984. As a result, the half-built structure was demolished and housing was built on that part of the site.

It was one of the last remaining stadiums in England to have the players tunnel and dressing rooms behind one of the goals, until it was covered for seating in time for the 2014-15 Premier League season and rebuilt between the David Fishwick and James Hargreaves stand. The ground originally consisted of just a pitch and the first grandstand was not built until 1885. Six years after this, the "Star" stand was erected and terracing was later added to the ends of the ground. After the Second World War, the stadium was redeveloped with all four stands being rebuilt. During the 1990s, the ground underwent further refurbishment when the Longside and Bee Hole End terraces were replaced by all-seater stands. Currently, the four stands at Turf Moor are the James Hargreaves Stand, the Jimmy McIlroy Stand, the Bob Lord Stand and the Cricket Field Stand.\r\n\r\nBurnley played their first match at the ground on 17 February 1883, losing 3â€“6 to local side Rawtenstall.

The first Football League match at the ground took place on 6 October 1888, with Fred Poland scoring the first competitive goal at the stadium. The record attendance at Turf Moor was set in 1924 when 54,755 people attended an FA Cup tie between Burnley and Huddersfield Town. In the same year, Turf Moor hosted its only FA Cup semi-final to date. In 1927, the stadium was the venue of an international match between England and Wales. Since then, the ground has been used to host matches in the European Under-19 Championship and European Under-21 Championship fixtures.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, plans for expansion of Turf Moor were released to the public.

The ground dates from 1919, at a time when Charlton were moderately successful and looking for a new home. The club found an abandoned sand and chalk pit in Charlton, but did not have sufficient funds to fully develop the site. An army of volunteer Charlton supporters dug out a massive pit for the pitch, and used the soil from the excavation to build up the sides. The grounds name most likely comes from its original valley-like appearance. The club played its first game at the ground before any seats, or even terraces, were installed; there was simply a roped-off pitch with the crowd standing or sitting on the adjoining earthworks. The unique circumstances of the grounds initial construction led to an unusually intense bond between the clubs supporters and the site that exists to this day. In the 1923â€“24 season, Charlton played at the Mount stadium in Catford but in a much higher populated area. A proposed merger with Catford South End FC fell through and thus Charlton moved back to the Valley.\r\n\r\nIn 1967, Len Silver the promoter at Hackney made an application to open Charlton as a British League speedway club, and plans were put forward to construct a track around the perimeter of the football pitch.

Although at its peak the ground had held over 40,000 (the record attendance being 41,826 for a match against Tottenham Hotspur in 1969) the Taylor Report, actioned after the 1989 Hillsborough Disaster had seen the legal requirement for English football stadia to become all-seater by 1994â€“95 season  resulting in its capacity dwindling to just 17,500 by the mid-1990s, not enough for the then-ambitious second tier club. An additional problem came with the grounds wooden components (considered unacceptable in the wake of the Bradford City stadium fire in 1985) and, in February 1996, chairman Lionel Pickering made the decision to move the club to a new stadium, having originally planned to rebuild the Baseball Ground as a 26,000-seat stadium.\r\n\r\nThe club originally planned to build a purpose-built 30,000-seat stadium at Pride Park, with 4,000 car parking spaces, restaurant and conference facilities, a fitness centre, a supporters club and new training ground. A year later the stadium plan was changed to become part of a Â£46 million project by the Stadivarios group that would also include a 10,000-seat indoor arena. However, Peter Gadsby, the clubs associate director at the time and head of the Miller Birch construction company felt the project was both too ambitious and expensive and instead plans were drawn up by new Chairman Lionel Pickering to modernise and extend the Baseball Ground to hold 26,000, at a cost of Â£10 million. However, despite signing a construction agreement with Taylor Woodrow, Gadsby suggested the club make a second attempt at securing the then-redeveloping Pride Park business park, settling with Derby City Council for a smaller site than previously agreed. On 21 February 1996, prior to a match against Luton Town at The Baseball Ground, the club announced to supporters the decision to move to a Â£16 m state-of-the-art stadium for the start of the 1997â€“98 season.\r\n\r\nDerby City Council were paid Â£1.8 million for the land and the clubs four directors â€“ Lionel Pickering, Peter Gadsby, Stuart Webb and John Kirkland each paid Â£2.5m towards a package deal to pay for the stadium. The stadium itself was based upon Middlesbroughs Riverside Stadium, which opened in 1995, though it had more than 30 amendments to the original plans.

The name of the stadium was chosen by the clubs fans, following a vote during the final game at Ayresome Park. The other choices available were Middlehaven Stadium, Erimus Stadium and Teesside Stadium.

Originally a velodrome, it was the finish line of the Tour de France from the first event in 1903 until General Charles de Gaulle ordered the track demolished in the late 1960s. He decided in 1967 that the Parc des Princes should be dedicated to football and rugby games with a capacity of under 60,000 seats. The Parc des Princes was the national stadium of the France football team and the France rugby union team until the construction of the Stade de France for the 1998 FIFA World Cup.

However, with a growing fan capacity and with arguments that the location of the Diekman stadium was not strategic enough, the idea was conceived to build a new arena for the FC Twente fans. The Diekman ground also faced problems with its seating plans as a result of previous FIFA regulations which imposed a necessity to construct a seating tribune behind each goal post.\r\n\r\nThe cost of the construction is estimated to have been around 33 million guilders and it took fourteen months to complete, with its foundation stone having been laid on 31 January 1997. Due to the tight budget available, the layout of the stadium was constructed in such a way that future expansions would be possible without the necessity to tear down entire stands.\r\n\r\nThe first match played at the stadium was a 3â€“0 victory by the home team against PSV on 10 May 1998 in an Eredivisie match.

At the time it was one of the most modern stadiums in the world, especially due to the moat around the pitch. After twenty years FC Utrecht felt the need for expansion and renewal. The main stand was moved to the North side and opened for the start of the 2001â€“2002 season.\r\n\r\nThe old main stand was rebuilt after that and a year later FC Utrecht had two new stands along the sides of the pitch. Last season, the goal stands were replaced, and the stadium now has 24,426 seats. The stadium was given its current name, Stadion Galgenwaard, in January 2002.\r\n\r\nSeven international matches of the Dutch national football team were played in the stadium, the first one being on April 27, 1983: a friendly against Sweden (0â€“3).

The first home-match in the new stadium took place in September 1999. The grand re-opening was on 25 January 2000.\r\n\r\nOne of the many advantages the renovated stadium offers is the improved atmosphere because the spectators are now situated much closer to the playing ground. Because of this the players have a better interaction with the crowd.\r\n\r\nThe playing ground and the rest of the stadium are separated from each other by a promenade which is situated under the spectatorsâ€™ seats. This promenade has a double function: It prevents supporters from entering the playing ground while at the same time containing food and beverage outlets as well as toilets.\r\n\r\nA specially constructed space under the playing ground can store heat to warm up the playing ground, so that matches can still take place during winter.\r\n\r\nIn November 2007 the board of NEC and the city of Nijmegen presented new plans for De Goffert. The capacity is intended to be increased to 20,000 and the stadium will be placed largely underground inside a large hill. This hill will also serve as a home for basketball (Matrixx Magixx), judo and other sports, creating a House of Topsports. The strange, but innovative, design is needed because the city will not allow the stadium to grow in height because of the Goffert Park, which is a protected nature-site.\r\n\r\nThe Nijmegen venue hosted three international matches of the Dutch national football team in the 1970s, with the last being a qualifying match for Euro 1980 on 20 September 1978 against Iceland: 3â€“0.

With a capacity of 35,000, it is the third-largest football stadium in the country. Established as the Philips Sportpark, it was constructed as a sports field for Philips employees in 1910. The Philips Elftal played football matches from 1911 until 1913, when the team was succeeded by PSV Eindhoven. Since 1913, they have used the ground has its home base.\r\n\r\nThe stadium has gone through several extensions in its history: after a wooden stand in 1916, seating and standing places slowly enclosed the field throughout the first decades. Two extensive renovations in the 1970s and 1990s first created a covered stadium, and then a two-tiered ground with extensive commercial spaces. The completion of the four corners in 2002 eventually led to its current capacity.\r\n\r\nThe Philips Stadion currently holds a four-star rating by UEFA. It has hosted a range of Netherlands national team fixtures since 1971. In 2013, PSVs reserve team Jong PSV also played their league matches at the stadium. They now paly their games at the trainingcomplex De Herdgang. Furthermore the Philips stadion was the location for three UEFA Euro 2000 group stage matches, as well as the 2006 UEFA Cup Final. Aside from football-related purposes, the ground is incidentally used for music concerts.\r\n\r\nIn 1910, the Philips company erected new houses to serve the growing need for employee housing. The area, fittingly named Philipsdorp (â€˜Philips Villageâ€™), was built on walking distance from the Philips factories and located (at that point) in the outskirts of Eindhoven. Urban planner Gerrit Jan de Jongh envisaged a village green in the center, creating a space for leisure and sports. In this green, a football field, a korfball field and a bandstand were planned. The area was named the Philips Sportpark. Meanwhile, Philips founded a football team for its young employees, named Philips Elftal. Their first match marks the first recorded use of the Philips Sportpark: on 15 January 1911, the Philips Elftal won their debut match against Hollandia from Woensel. The Philips Elftal continued to play at the field for two seasons; in 1913 the team was succeeded by PSV, who also took the Philips Sportpark as their home ground. PSVâ€™s first official home game was the Eindhoven derby against EVV on 10 October 1915.\r\n\r\nIn its first years, the field did not include any seating space for spectators. This changed in 1916, when the first wooden stand was built, providing room for 550 viewers. The stand was offered by Philips, who were celebrating their 25th anniversary that year. Later, it was replaced by a new main stand in 1933, providing seating space for 900 spectators. Five years later, during PSVâ€™s twenty-fifth anniversary, a scoreboard was installed in the stadium. The board was a gift by the official PSV fan union. In 1941, PSV decided to build stands across the entire ground. The decision was made to create an oval shape with a running track between field and stands, enabling the possibility for athletic, cycling and ice skating matches. After completion, the capacity rose to 18,000. During the Second World War, the ground was claimed by German occupants and used for military purposes. The final days of World War II witnessed great destruction in the city of Eindhoven and also to the stadium itself. Repairs were duly made.\r\n\r\nIn 1953, the main stand was refurbished and extended, creating space for a press room and meeting spaces. Also, a memorial was revealed, commemorating the war victims. In 1958, the running track was removed, making space for a bigger field. New stands are built as well, increasing the capacity to 22,000. Four 40-meter high floodlights were installed by Philips in the stadium in the same year, making evening matches possible. The lights were inaugurated on April 9 with an exhibition match against RSC Anderlecht. A complete renovation of the stadium started in 1969. After its completion in 1977, the stadium was completely enclosed and every seat was covered. The main (south) stand peaked above the other stands. The capacity rose to 26,500, of which 12,000 were for standing spectators. The renovated ground was celebrated with a match against Leeds United. Earlier, the ground was used by the Dutch national football team for the first time. On November 17, 1971, the Netherlands played a qualifying match for the 1972 UEFA European Championship against Luxembourg (8â€“0).\r\n\r\nIn April 1987, cracks in the south stand were discovered. The damage was caused by an alkaliâ€“silica reaction. PSV chairman Jacques Ruts decided to rebuild the stand, and simultaneously provide more space for business relations and sponsors. Up until then, the stadium only offered regular spectator seats. Ruts got inspired by the way American stadiums had built luxury boxes and used them for business opportunities. After the renovation (which costed 40 million guilders), the new south stand was two-tiered, with 830 VIP-seats behind glass in the middle. Also, new offices, a press room, a youth hall and a restaurant were created. The opening of the stand was celebrated with an exhibition match against AC Milan on 17 August 1988. Two years later, the ground changed its name from Philips Sportpark to Philips Stadion.\r\n\r\nIn the nineties, the other stands were also raised to the level of the south stand. The west and east stand were expanded in 1993, and the north stand in 1996. After completion, the seating capacity reached 30,000. Until then, the fanatic part of the PSV support would be located on the so-called L-side on standing terraces. After the renovations in the nineties, the standing terraces disappeared and the fanatic fans moved to the east stand. The renovations in the 1990s were in time for UEFA Euro 2000, held in the Netherlands and Belgium. The Philips Stadion hosted three group matches; Portugal beat England with 3-2, Sweden and Turkey ended in a goalless draw, and Italy won against Sweden (2-1). The last major renovation was the closing of the four open corners of the stadium. The two corners on the north side were built in 2000; the corners on the south side were finalized in 2001. Along with creating more seats, the new corners had window blind-type constructions, which allowed air to flow through in order to let the grass breath. These frames can be closed during events, to protect spectators from weather conditions. The four corners were designed by Toon van Aken.\r\n\r\nIn March 2001, PSV faced 1. FC Kaiserslautern in an UEFA Cup fixture. During the match, fans were provoked by Kaiserslautern players, resulting in spectators attempting to break through a fence separating the stands and the field. After the gate was cracked, PSV coach Eric Gerets and several players had to personally stop the fans from entering the field. After this incident, problems with fan violence faded and in the summer of 2005, the PSV board decided to remove the tall fences around the pitch. They were replaced with 35 inches (90 cm) high railings keeping the spectators off the grass. Unauthorized persons who do invade the pitch will receive a 15,000 euro penalty and a ten-year-ban from visiting the Philips Stadion. The 2006 UEFA Cup Final was held in the Philips Stadion; Sevilla managed to beat Middlesbrough with 4-0. For the final, the stadium was temporarily named â€˜PSV Stadionâ€™, because UEFA did not allow the Philips name to be used.\r\n\r\n\r\nPress room at the Philips Stadion prior to a press conference.\r\nPlans to further expand the ground to 45,000 seats have been examined, but turned down after the Netherlands lost the 2018 FIFA World Cup bid. In 2011, the ground under the stadium (and the training facilities) were sold for â‚¬48,4 million to the Eindhoven municipality in a leasehold estate construction. In recent years, the stadium has gone through several minor modernization programs: the fourth floor was renovated in 2008, LED-powered advertisement boarding was installed by Philips in 2009. In 2012, a modernization plan for the ground was presented. The plan included new entrances, sponsor lodges and parts of the stands. The second floor of the stadium was renovated in 2013.

Over the athletics track, a new stand was built, behind the goals so as to reduce the distance between the terrace and the playing field, with the central terraces remaining intact. The new format of the stadium, which almost halved its maximum capacity to 23,486 seats, came under harsh criticism.\r\n\r\nCagliari Calcio president Massimo Cellino has plans to build a new stadium for the football team to play in, however the council and mayor Emilio Floris refused to give consent for the project to go ahead, despite the fact that Cellino was willing to finance the new stadium himself.\r\n\r\nHowever plans were drawn up, and the draft revealed in September 2007, with Cellino and Cagliari Calcio meeting all expenses. The project provides a stadium with 25,000 seats. The plan declares that construction will commence in August 2009, and is expected to be completed a year later. But late in 2009, Cagliari Calcio proposed a revamped plan for the Karalis Arena, in order to be added to the list of the Euro 2016 candidature. The new stadium will be able to accommodate about 30,000 spectators and will have new Skybox, restaurants and cafÃ©.\r\n\r\nDue to disagreements with the new local administration headed by mayor Massimo Zedda and growing safety concerns regarding the venue, Cagliari left Stadio SantElia in the final weeks of the 2011â€“12 Serie A season, playing the remaining few home games at Stadio Nereo Rocco, Trieste. For the 2012â€“13 Serie A season, Cagliari played its home games outside its home city, at Stadio Comunale Is Arenas in Quartu SantElena, thus ultimately putting an end to its long-standing association with Stadio SantElia.\r\n\r\nHowever, Cagliari cancelled their contract at Stadio Is Arenas in April, 2013 after having safety issues with local authorities all season which forced them playing behind closed doors in several matches. It was announced on October 19, 2013 that Cagliari would return to the Stadio Santâ€™Elia for the remainder of 2013-14 Serie A season.\r\n\r\nOn August 1, 2014, after a deal with the local council, new Cagliari President Tommaso Giulini announced that Stadio Santâ€™Elia would be expanded to hold at least 11,650 fans for the 2014-15 Serie A season.

It primarily serves as the home stadium of the Columbus Crew SC of Major League Soccer. Built in 1999, it is the first soccer-specific stadium built for a professional soccer team in the second professional era of American soccer. The stadium is named for Madrid-based Mapfre Insurance after the company signed a sponsorship agreement announced on March 3, 2015. The listed seating capacity is 19,968.\r\n\r\nIn addition to Crew SC home games, Mapfre Stadium is also the site of a variety of additional events in amateur and professional soccer, American football, lacrosse, and rugby. The stadium is also a regular site for outdoor concerts due to the permanent stage in the north end zone.\r\n\r\nColumbus Crew SC played their first three seasons at Ohio Stadium on the campus of the Ohio State University. During games, large sections of the stadium were blocked off to reduce capacity from approximately 90,000 to 25,243. Although the Crew enjoyed success at Ohio Stadium during their tenure there, the large seating capacity and limitations to the field size made the stadium ill-suited for soccer. Additionally, Ohio Stadium lacked permanent field lights. These problems, along with planned renovations to Ohio Stadium, which began in 1999, were all factors in the development of Mapfre Stadium. The construction cost of US$28.5 million was covered entirely with private funds from Crew owner and oil billionaire Lamar Hunt and his Hunt Sports group. It is located on the grounds of the Ohio Expo Center and State Fairgrounds.\r\n\r\nMapfre Stadium opened on May 15, 1999 as Columbus Crew Stadium with a match between the home side and the New England Revolution. It is the first major league soccer-specific stadium in the United States, and has been credited with inspiring the wave of construction of soccer-specific stadiums throughout the league. In the 2010 Showcase issue of Stadia Magazine, Ian Nuttall stating "Whod have thought when it opened in 1999 that Major League Soccers first purpose-built stadium would kick-start the wave of dedicated soccer specific stadiums that continue today?"  The seating capacity was originally 22,555 until 2008 when construction of a permanent stage in the north end zone reduced seating capacity to the current 20,455, with room to expand to 30,000 total seats for concerts.\r\n\r\nAfter nearly 15 years of the stadium not having a corporate sponsor, the Crew announced naming rights were sold to Madrid-based Mapfre Insurance on March 3, 2015.

Fans and sports writers have affectionately nicknamed the arena "The Rock" in reference to the Rock of Gibraltar, the corporate logo of Prudential Financial, a financial institution that owns the naming rights to the arena and is headquartered within walking distance of it. In December 2013, the arena ranked third nationally and ninth internationally for self-reported annual revenue.\r\n\r\nThe arena was built amidst financial concerns and years of speculation that the Devils would relocate, despite the fact that the team was a perennial playoff contender and was often at or near the top of the NHLs standings for nearly two decades. The arena is located two blocks from Newark Penn Station in downtown Newark, just west of Newarks Ironbound district, making it easily accessible via New Jersey Transit, PATH, Newark Light Rail, and Amtrak. At the time of its opening, Prudential Center was the first major league sports venue to be built in the New York metropolitan area since the Brendan Byrne Arena, the Devils former home, opened in 1981.

It hosted the MLB All-Star Game that same year. Many sportscasters and fans continue to use the name Comiskey Park. Prior to its demolition, the old Comiskey Park was the oldest in-use ballpark in Major League Baseball, a title now held by Fenway Park in Boston. The current public address announcer is Gene Honda, who also serves as the PA announcer for the Chicago Blackhawks.\r\n\r\nThe stadium is situated just to the west of the Dan Ryan Expressway in Chicagos Armour Square neighborhood, adjacent to the more famous neighborhood of Bridgeport.

It is the home ballpark for the New York Yankees of Major League Baseball, and will also be the home of New York City FC of Major League Soccer. The $2.3 billion stadium, built with $1.2 billion in public subsidies, replaced the original Yankee Stadium. It is one block north of the original, on the 24-acre former site of Macombs Dam Park; the 8-acre site of the original stadium is now a public park called Heritage Field. The first game at the new Yankee Stadium was a preseason exhibition game against the Chicago Cubs on April 3, 2009; the Yankees won, 7â€“4. The first regular-season game was played on April 16, a 10â€“2 Yankee loss to the Cleveland Indians.\r\n\r\nThe stadium incorporates replicas of some design elements from the original Yankee Stadium. Although stadium construction began in August 2006, the project spanned many years and faced many controversies, including the high public cost and the loss of public parkland. The overall price tag makes the new Yankee Stadium the most expensive stadium ever built.\r\n\r\nNew York Yankees owner George Steinbrenner began campaigning for a new stadium in the early 1980s, just a few years after the remodeled Yankee Stadium opened. Steinbrenner at the time was reportedly considering a move to the Meadowlands Sports Complex in New Jersey. Governor Thomas Kean in 1984 authorized the use of land for a new baseball stadium in the Meadowlands, but the state legislature did not provide financing for the stadium. In a statewide referendum in 1987, New Jersey taxpayers rejected $185 million in public financing for a baseball stadium for the Yankees. Despite the rejection from New Jersey, Steinbrenner frequently used a threatened move there as leverage in negotiations with New York City. In 1988, New York Mayor Ed Koch agreed to have city taxpayers spend $90 million on a second renovation of Yankee Stadium that included luxury boxes and restaurants inside the stadium and parking garages and traffic improvements outside. Steinbrenner agreed in principle, but then backed out of the deal. In 1993, Mayor David Dinkins expanded on Kochs proposal by offering his Bronx Center vision for the neighborhood, including new housing, a new courthouse, and relocating the Police Academy nearby. In 1993, New York Governor Mario Cuomo proposed using the West Side Yard, a 30-acre rail yard along the West Side of Manhattan and owned by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, as the location for new stadium for the Yankees. But Cuomo lost his re-election bid a few months later. By 1995, Steinbrenner had rejected 13 proposals to keep the Yankees in the Bronx. In 1998, Bronx Borough President Fernando Ferrer proposed spending $600 million in public money to add dozens of luxury boxes to the stadium, to improve highway and public transportation access, and to create a Yankee Village, with shops, restaurants, and a museum. Steinbrenner rejected this as well. That same year, Mayor Rudy Giuliani unveiled a plan to relocate the Yankees to the West Side Yard for a $1 billion stadium. But with most of the funding coming from taxpayers, Giuliani tabled the proposal, fearing rejection in a citywide referendum. The West Side Stadium plan resurfaced in December 2001. Months after the September 11 attack, Giuliani announced "tentative agreements" for both the New York Yankees and New York Mets to build new stadiums. He estimated that both stadiums would cost $2 billion, with city and state taxpayers contributing $1.2 billion.\r\n\r\nMichael Bloomberg, who succeeded Giuliani as mayor in 2002, called the former mayors agreements "corporate welfare" and exercised the escape clause in the agreements to back out of both deals, saying that the city could not afford to build new stadiums for the Yankees and Mets. Bloomberg said that Giuliani had inserted a clause in this deal which loosened the teams leases with the city and would allow the Yankees and Mets to leave the city on 60 days notice to find a new home elsewhere if the city backed out of the agreement. At the time, Bloomberg said that publicly funded stadiums were a poor investment. Bloombergs blueprint for the stadium was unveiled in 2004, at the same time as the plan for the Mets new stadium, Citi Field. The final cost for the two stadiums was more than $3.1 billion; taxpayer subsidies accounted for $1.8 billion.', 'Bronx, New York', 'newyork.yankees.mlb.com', 'www.facebook.com/Yankees', 'twitter.com/yankees', 'instagram.com/yankees', '', 'http://www.thesportsdb.com/images/media/team/badge/wqwwxx1423478766.png', '', ''),

Globe Life is owned by Torchmark Corporation, which is based in McKinney, Texas, a northern suburb of Dallas.\r\n\r\nFunding was approved for a new home for the Rangers in 1991 by the City of Arlington. Construction began on April 2, 1992 a short distance away from Arlington Stadium, the stadium it would replace, and the new Ballpark in Arlington opened on April 1, 1994 in an exhibition contest between the Rangers and the New York Mets.

Schwarz Architectural Services of Washington, D.C. The Rangers chose to build a retro-style ballpark, incorporating many features of baseballs Jewel Box parks. A roofed home run porch in right field is reminiscent of Tiger Stadium, while the white steel frieze that surrounds the upper deck was copied from the pre-1973 Yankee Stadium. The out-of-town scoreboard (removed in 2009 and replaced with a state-of-the-art videoboard) was built into the left-field wallâ€”a nod to Fenway Park, while the numerous nooks and crannies in the outfield fence are a reminder of Ebbets Field. The arched windows are a reminder of Comiskey Park. However, it has a few distinct features of its own. Several traditional Texas-style stone carvings are visible throughout it. A four-story office building in center field encloses it, with a white steel multilevel facade similar to the facade on the roof.\r\n\r\nAs the stadium was built on one of the former Arlington Stadium parking lots, the irregular dimensions of the outfield were planned independently, rather than being forced by neighboring structures. The home plate, foul poles, and bleachers were originally at Arlington Stadium.

Bush (former part Rangers owner, later Texas Governor and President of the United States).\r\n\r\nThe stadiums 810-foot (250 m)-long facades are made of brick and Texas Sunset Red granite. Bas-relief friezes depict significant scenes from the history of both Texas and baseball. The calculus of seating arrangements represented a new economic model for the sport: a critical mass of high-dollar seats close to the infield boost ticket revenue. The stadium has three basic seating tiers: lower, club and upper deck. Two levels of luxury suites occupy spaces behind sliding glass doors above and below the club tier.\r\n\r\nThe stadium has a large number of obstructed-view seats. In some cases, the view is cut off by an overhang or underhang, and others are directly in front of the foul or support poles. Also, the design of the upper deck leaves it one of the highest in baseball. The view from the grandstand reserved sections in left is particularly obstructed.\r\n\r\nPrior to the 2012 season, the visitor bullpen was reconfigured to be parallel to the field after the previous visitor bullpen configuration had excessive amount of heat during hot weather games.

As a trader you can enter contracts or trades on either the buy or sell directions (buy if you think one currency will strengthen and go up versus another, or sell if you think it will go down on the pair).</p>\n\n<p>This market also give many more opportunities to trade around your schedule as it is open 24 hours a day, 5.5 days a week.&nbsp; At BlackBull Markets, our clients have access to different amounts of leverage that translates into purchasing power.&nbsp; This means that smaller moves in the market can be as profitable as the larger ones.&nbsp; Using this leverage, our clients can speculate and profit from global currency flows as different currencies increase and decrease in value with volatility.&nbsp; The key advantage with the Forex market is due to it currently being the largest market and most liquid financial market in the world.&nbsp; It is many times larger than the New York and London stock exchanges combined.&nbsp; The fact that it is open 24 hours a day to trade, has a decentralized structure, and low barriers to entry, trading the Forex market through BlackBull Markets allows and provides the key opportunity for clients to trade using many different styles on their terms.&nbsp; This allows for the highest profit making potential and lifestyle balance.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Trading FX works by traders hoping to generate profits or income by speculating on the future value of one currency to another.&nbsp; This means that currencies are always traded as pairs.&nbsp; Trading FX in different combinations offers a vast amount of opportunities to profit from.&nbsp; The exchange rates change between different global currencies. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Let&#39;s say for example you purchase 10,000 euros with US dollars at the EUR/USD (this is code for the pair) at an exchange rate of 1.1800. &nbsp;This means that you have exchanged 11,800 USD to buy 10,000 euros thinking that the Euro will increase in value over the US dollar.&nbsp; The next day you were right and the current exchange rate has changed in your favor to 1.2500.&nbsp; So you then exchange your 10,000 euros back into US Dollars, but now you have 12,500 having only paid 11,800.&nbsp; This means the difference is 700 dollars of profit. Simply put, your Euros have become worth more so when converting them back they have gone up 700 dollars in value.&nbsp; This is the theory of what goes on when you place your trades.&nbsp; If math isn&#39;t your strong suit due to how fast some trading decisions need to be made then that&rsquo;s OK.&nbsp; The actual trading platforms we offer at BlackBull markets make it very simple.&nbsp; With just a click of a button, our clients can decide how large a position they want to buy in a pair, placing the order, or closing the trade. You can learn more about this in the education section, which will take you from knowing nothing, to giving you strategies on how to trade the FX markets with amazing success!</p>\n', '', 1, 0, '', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', 0, '2015-03-01 00:00:00', ''),

(90, 'Risk Warning', 'risk-warning', 'Risk Policy | Secure FX Trading - BlackBull Markets', '', '', '', '<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The Contracts offered by BlackBull Markets are speculative products that can be highly leveraged and carry significantly greater risk than non-leveraged investments. You should carefully read this section and then consider whether trading in leveraged Contracts is right for you given your personal circumstances (financial, taxation, and otherwise) before you begin trading with us. We encourage you to seek independent financial, legal, and other professional advice to assist in qualifying your decision.<br />\nThe risk inherent in trading speculative leveraged products is that adverse price direction to a position is amplified to the degree of leverage employed. It is possible to lose more than the equity in your Account as a result and you will be liable to pay these additional amounts.It is reasonably foreseeable that, following a trade, you may receive, in total, less than the amount deposited by you to BlackBull Markets in your Account. Trading can result in losses that are greater than your Account balance.</p>\n\n<p>Under certain conditions, it could become difficult or impossible for you to liquidate a position (this can, for example, happen when there is a significant change in prices over a short period). The inability to liquidate a position in no way eliminates your liability to BlackBull Markets.</p>\n\n<p>The risk of loss in trading in leveraged instruments such as the products offered by BlackBull Markets can be substantial. You should be cautious of the amount of leverage you apply and carefully consider whether trading leveraged instruments is appropriate for you.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Some of the significant risks involved in the Contracts include the following.</strong><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The high degree of leverage that is obtainable in these types of Contracts, because of small margin requirements, can work both for and against you. The use of leverage can lead to large losses as well as large gains. You may be required to pay further amounts to cover fees.</p>\n\n<p>You may lose more than the amount deposited with BlackBull Markets.</p>\n\n<p>Derivative market volatility</p>\n\n<p>Currencies, futures, contracts for difference and derivatives are speculative and highly volatile. Prices can fluctuate rapidly and may reflect unforeseeable events or changes in conditions. These can be difficult, if not impossible, to predict.</p>\n\n<p>Combined with high leverage utilisation, the volatility can create a situation where a relatively small adverse market movement may result in a loss.</p>\n\n<p>Sometimes markets move so fast that &lsquo;gapping&rsquo; occurs. This is where markets move so quickly that sudden drops or increases occur. If this occurs in the underlying market, it also affects the price and may mean you are unable to close out a position or open a new position for the price at which you have placed the order.</p>\n\n<p>The placing of pending orders (such as a stop-loss order) may not always limit your losses to the amounts desired. Conditions may prevent execution of such orders.</p>\n\n<p>Your order at all times relies on BlackBull Markets to execute at related prices in the market. If BlackBull Markets is unable to do this, your executed price may be more or less than reflected in the market at that given moment. Such &ldquo;slippage&rdquo; is a source of risk.</p>\n\n<p>The spread between the bid and ask of a quote fluctuates with the liquidity and volatility of the market. If you open a position and then close it before the market has&nbsp;moved favourably, you may still incur a loss to the extent of the spread and any fees and commissions payable.</p>\n\n<p>Factors in the underlying market<br />\nAs the price of the Contract is based upon the movement of underlying assets, factors affecting the relevant currencies will also affect your position.</p>\n\n<p>The value of a Contract will be affected by market risk. Markets are affected by a range of factors, including economic, taxation and regulatory conditions, market sentiment, political events, interest rate movements, currency movements, environmental and technology issues. Emerging and developing markets are considered higher risk, and can be significantly more volatile.</p>\n\n<p>Please read and understand this document.</p>\n\n<p>Kind Regards, the BlackBull Markets team.</p>\n', '', 1, 0, '', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', 0, '2015-02-21 00:00:00', '');
